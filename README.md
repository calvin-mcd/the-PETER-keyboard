# the PETER keyboard

compact 60ish keyboard inspired by 40s layouts & formfactors

I designed this keyboard after asking my friend Peter what his ideal keyboard would be. His answer was:"Ehm... I like numbers!". So I tried to make a board that keeps the functionality of a 60% keyboard while offering it in a 40s inspired form factor.

It takes inspiration from ai03’s [UT47.2](https://github.com/ai03-2725/UT47.2) and EODesigns\#4352’s [Humble40](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=112927.0) as well as trash man\#6005’s [v4n4g0n](https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/v4n4g0n) and NoahK\#1290’s [Monorail](https://trashman.wiki/community/pcbs/monorail) pcbs.

The case is based on rain\#3950's [mfr2](https://github.com/rainkeebs/mfr2) and has been edited by Gizzle\#9369 to allow for bottom mounting inspired by projectcain\#5265's [vault35](https://mechvault.net/products/vault-35-mini-keyboard)
