# the PETER keyboard
compact 60ish keyboard inspired by 40s layouts & formfactors

I designed this keyboard after asking my friend Peter what his ideal keyboard would be. His answer was:"Ehm...  I like numbers!". So I tried to make a board that keeps the functionality of a 60% keyboard while offering it in a 40s inspired form factor.

The case is based on rain#3950's [mfr2](https://github.com/rainkeebs/mfr2) and has been edited by Gizzle#9369 to allow for bottom mounting inspired by projectcain#5265's [vault35](https://mechvault.net/products/vault-35-mini-keyboard)
