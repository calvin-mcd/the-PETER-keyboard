# the PETER keyboard
compact 60ish keyboard inspired by the 40s formfactor

I designed this keyboard after asking my friend Peter what his ideal keyboard would be. His answer was:"Ehm...  I like numbers!". So I tried to make a board that keeps the functionality of a 60% keyboard while offering it in a 40s inspired form factor.

The case is based on rain#3950's [mfr2](https://github.com/rainkeebs/mfr2) and has been edited by Gizzle#9369 to allow for bottom mounting inspired by projectcain#5265's [vault35](https://mechvault.net/products/vault-35-mini-keyboard)

Please note that this project has been tested but I am *not responsible* for any outcomes of its use. However, feel free to edit, modify and otherwise utilise these files.
 
 As always big thanks to the many people who helped me with the pcb, firmware and much more! Escpecially NoahK#1290, ICEAGE, DANA, SIERRY & Tweetybird!
